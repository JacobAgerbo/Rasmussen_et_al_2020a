#  eDNA based biomonitoring at an experimental German vineyard to characterise how management regimes shape ecosystem diversity
Bioinformatic and analytical pipeline for processing amplicon data, generated from D2 and Zeale primers from Rasmussen et al. 2020a

## Bioinformatic pipeline for Zeale amplicons in short
* Quality Assessment
* Trimming and Adaptor-Removal
* Sorting and filtering with Begum (https://github.com/shyamsg/Begum)
* OTU Clustering
* Taxanomic Assignment
* Please find protocols in the respective repositories

## Bioinformatic pipeline for D2 amplicons in short
* Quality Assessment
* Quality filtering, primer removal, de-replication, and singleton removal
* OTU Clustering
* Taxanomic Assignment to curated D2 database (https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/1e9e4303c5b82b63d505eeaa1e585fc5/published-archive.html)
